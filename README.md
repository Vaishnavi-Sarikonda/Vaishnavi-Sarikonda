I am passionate about leveraging data to drive decision-making and operational efficiency.

ðŸŒ± I recently worked on several impactful projects, including:
- **Data Migration and Analytics Platform Transition**: At Johnson and Johnson, I performed data migration, rewrote SQL queries, and integrated data between JDE and S4HANA, which enhanced user reliability by 10% and increased productivity by 15%.
- **Predictive Analytics and Technical Support**: As an IT Support Technician at Texas Tech University, I used predictive analytics to reduce resolution times and provided technical support to faculty and staff.
- **Full Stack Web Development and Automation**: At Deloitte, I designed a full stack web application, performed front-end fixes, and utilized machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis to improve project efficiency by 20%.

I have experience with various tools and technologies, including SQL, Python, Java, Microsoft PowerBI, Tableau, and Qlik. I am skilled in developing interactive dashboards and reports to provide actionable insights.

I am looking to collaborate on data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning projects. If you have any opportunities or projects where I can contribute, feel free to reach out!
